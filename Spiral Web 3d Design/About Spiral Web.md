# 🌈 Colorful Turtle Spiral

This Python program uses the **turtle** graphics library to create a colorful spiral pattern.  
It cycles through rainbow colors while drawing, producing a mesmerizing geometric design.

## 🚀 How It Works
- The turtle moves forward in increasing steps.
- It rotates at a fixed angle (59°) on each loop.
- Colors change dynamically from a predefined list.

## 🖥️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## ▶️ Run the Code
```bash
